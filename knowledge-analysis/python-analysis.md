I'll give you a 3.5/5 in Python as a language, based on what you've learned so far. Here's why:

âœ… Strengths (3.5) :
- Worked with system arguments: Handling sys.argv and parsing command-line inputs.
- Solid foundational knowledge: You understand Python syntax, functions, loops, comprehensions, lambdas, dictionaries, and exception handling.
- List comprehensions & lambda usage: A sign of intermediate Python skills.
- Custom implementations of built-in functions: Youâ€™ve recoded filter(), tqdm(), etc.
- Python packaging: Youâ€™ve built and installed a Python package.
- Good problem-solving ability: Your experience in C helps with logic and algorithms.

ðŸ“Œ Missing or Weak Areas :
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): No mention of classes, inheritance, or encapsulation.
- Advanced Python features: No exposure to decorators, metaclasses, or context managers.
- AI/ML-specific Python skills: No work with NumPy, pandas, or machine learning libraries yet.
- Asynchronous programming: No mention of asyncio, threading, or multiprocessing.

ðŸ“ˆ How to Reach 5/5 : 
- Learn and practice OOP in Python (classes, inheritance, polymorphism).
- Get hands-on with data science libraries (NumPy, pandas).
- Explore async programming (asyncio, multiprocessing).
- Learn Pythonic best practices (context managers, with statements).
- Try Leetcode/Codeforces challenges in Python for better problem-solving.
- You're well on your way to becoming an advanced Python developer! ðŸš€ Keep pushing forward.
